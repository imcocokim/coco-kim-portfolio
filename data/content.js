const bio = [
 `Hello! My name is Coco Kim from New York City. I am  a recent Software Engineer graduate from General Assembly. I graduated from Rutgers-Newark University with a BFA in Graphic Design. I also received a Grand Diploma in Professional Culinary Arts from the International Culinary Center. I have many passions and nothing can stop me from continuously exploring them. I have a range of experiences and qualities that not a lot of candidates can offer.<p>As a graphic designer, I worked mostly on redesigning websites to be responsive. After a few years, I realized I needed to follow my heart and become a chef. I initially started as a prep cook at Huertas in NYC. Within a year and a half of working my way up, I became the sous chef, even though I had not been professionally trained before. After teaching, private cooking and volunteering, I decided to pivot again and explore software engineering. I am determined to break through the industry and excited to see what's in store for me.</p>
