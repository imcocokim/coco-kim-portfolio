 'Coco is a former graphic designer (although she does some occasional freelance work) who followed her heart and became a chef. She initially started as a prep cook at Huertas in NYC. Within a year and a half of working her way up, she became the sous chef, even though she had not been professionally trained before. During her time at Huertas, she was also a freelance private chef for different occasions (i.e. dinner and/or cocktail parties, meal prepping for young couples, etc). After three years there, she left Huertas to pursue private cooking and teaching. <p>Coco is a former graphic designer (although she does some occasional freelance work) who followed her heart and became a chef.
